# Notes for OOP
1 - Inheritance -> to establish relationship with classes of same object
    ex: creating a SUPERCLASS/PARENT CLASS that has all the necessary components
        create SUBCLASSES/CHILD CLASS which inherits/reuses the components of the ParentClass with its own specific components

        
2 - Polymorphism ->
3 - Encapsulation
4 - Abstraction
